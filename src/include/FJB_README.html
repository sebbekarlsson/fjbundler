  <h1>Fast Javascript Bundler</h1>
</p>

<p><img alt="Compile and test" src="https://github.com/sebbekarlsson/fjb/workflows/Compile%20and%20test/badge.svg?branch=master" />
<a href="https://fjbundler.com">https://fjbundler.com</a></p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is what it says it is.<br />
However, this bundler aims to be a monolithic does-it-all type of bundler;
with zero configuration needed. <em>(however, optional configuration will be supported)</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<ol>
<li>A bundler should not need excessive attention.</li>
<li>A bundler should not get in the way of a developers workflow.</li>
<li>A bundler should be fast.</li>
<li>A bundler should not be written in Javascript / Node.</li>
<li>Commonly used features among JS developers should be supported out of the box.</li>
<li>The output of the bundler should work everywhere. (to an extent which is possible of course)</li>
</ol>
<h3>More About the Philosophy</h3>
<h4>Output formats</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Most bundlers allows you to select an output format of the code, such as:
<code>"CommonJS", "AMD", "System", "UMD", "ES6", "ES2015" or "ESNext"</code>
FJB does not implement this concept.<br />
Instead, FJB adapts the code automatically through static analysis.<br />
FJB aims to generate code that works everywhere (when possible).<br />
A bundler should be smart enough so that the developer can focus on other things. :brain:</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How does one use it?</h2>
<p><code>bash
fjb index.js</code></p>
<h2>What if I want the output in a file?</h2>
<p><code>bash
fjb index.js &gt; dist.js</code></p>

<h2>Benchmarks :rocket:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To see benchmarks, have a look at <a href="benchmarks.md">benchmarks.md</a> :fire:<br />
You can also view them over at <a href="https://fjbundler.com">https://fjbundler.com</a></p>

<h2>Installing the easy way</h2>
<h3>Using apt</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to install FJB is to head over to <a href="https://github.com/sebbekarlsson/fjb/releases">releases</a> and
download a <code>.deb</code> file that suits you.<br />
Then you can simply run:
<code>bash
sudo apt install ./&lt;filename&gt;.deb</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Installing the complicated way</h2>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To build <code>fjb</code> you will need the following:
1. A C compiler (I would suggest gcc)
2. Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Steps to Install :wrench:</h3>
<h4>Compiling it</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clone down the repository</li>
<li>Run:
<code>bash
./build.sh</code><blockquote>
<p>This step will generate a <code>fjb.out</code> executable file.<br />
You can start using this right away. :tophat:</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Installing globally</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>To continue and install <code>fjb</code> globally:
Run:
<code>bash
make install</code>
Also make sure you add <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code>
to your PATH.<br />

<h2>Questions and Answers :question:</h2>
<h3>How fast is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Have a look at <a href="benchmarks.md">benchmarks.md</a> :fire:</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How serious is this?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Not sure, it's just a hobby project at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why are you making this?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Frustration, frustration with existing tools.<br />
The existing alternatives are not fast enough, and gets in the
way a bit more than they should.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Is it mature enough to use it with React?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You can definitely bundle React apps with FJB.<br />
However, there might be some missing features / bugs since the JSX
implementation in FJB is pretty new.<br />
You can see a working React example <a href="tests/src/test_projects/with_react">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Should I use it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not encourage anyone to use it, but feel free to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Does it work on Linux?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Does it work on Windows?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably not, but feel free to make a pull-request with the required changes
for it to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Does it work on MacOS?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably.
I haven't tried it, but I would definitely think so.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes you can. Simply fork it and start making pull-requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I create a plugin for it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Have a look at this <a href="PLUGINS.md">guide</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Will you add support for writing plugins in Javascript?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>No. I don't think Javascript belongs in a bundler.<br />
The reason why most bundlers today are slow, is because they are written in Javascript.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What if I find a bug?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you find a bug, please report it here: <a href="https://github.com/sebbekarlsson/fjb/issues">https://github.com/sebbekarlsson/fjb/issues</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Does it support Typescript?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but this feature is under development... so expect bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I change the JSX format?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no need to worry about that, FJB knows if you're using React or not,
and automatically takes care of it for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What license is FJB under?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>GPL-3.0, <a href="LICENSE.md">LICENSE.md</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>I'm having problems installing FJB</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel free to create an issue here, and I'll be able to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Can I become a collaborator?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I would prefer if you make pull-requests through forking at first.<br />
Once I've seen that you've made valuable contributions, you might be able to
be added as a collaborator.</p>
